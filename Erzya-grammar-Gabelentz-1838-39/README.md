# Erzya grammar by Gabelentz, 1838â€“39
Herr Conrad von Der Gabelentz's grammar is an erudite interpretation of grammatical phenomena to be found in the first Erzya translation of the Gospel published in 1821, i.e. this is the first bit of parallel corpus work in Erzya studies.
The grammar can be viewed [here](https://rueter.github.io/Erzya-grammar-Gabelentz-1838-39/GabelentzHCVonDer-Versuch-einer-mordwinischen-Grammatik-1838-39.html).
