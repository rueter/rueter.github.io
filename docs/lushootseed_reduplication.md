# Lushootseed reduplication

Lushootseed reduplication is fascinating.
According to Bates, Hess and Hilbert (1994: xvii; Hess and Hilbert 1977; Bates 1986), there are seven different types of reduplication.

Reduplication one (red1) is described as CV+ with variants in Ci+, CVʔ+, Ciʔ+ smallness, diminished action, endearment [diminutive reduplication; the root vowel is oftern lost or reduced to ə. Several stems irregularly have Cə+ fo the diminutive.]

Reduplication two (red2) is described as CVC+ items are distributed about, plural [distributive; when the third sound is l, w or y, they become l̕, w̓, y̓ in this reduplication. A small number of high frequency stems have +VC or Cə+ for the distributive]

Reduplication three (red3) is described as +VC Random, ineffectual action, inconclusive action, languid state [out of control reduplication]

Reduplication four (red4) is described as CV+ with variants in +VC, CVC+ [reduplications for counting people]

Reduplication five (red5) is described as +VC particularized, individualized, or isolated people or adverbs [reduplication appearing especially on the emphatic pronouns (cf. dibəɬ)]

Reduplication six (red6) is described as VV intensified or augmented groups or events, plural [augmentative reduplication doubles the first vowel; if the first vowel is ‹ə›, it is replaced by ‹a›, which is then doubled]

Reduplication seven (red7) is described as CV+ homogenekous collection, plural [collective reduplication]

In this paper, I will examine the form of the separate reduplication models according to the notation provided in the Lushootseed dictionary (1994).
I am going to deal with the nature of the reduplication and attempt to keep their nature separate from their function.

Since I intend to persue a description that allows for form discovery, I will first outline the forms of repuplications attested in the dictionary.
My assumption is that all patterns of reduplication can be derived from the first three sounds of the word stem, which I will refer to with the Western Arabic numerals ‹1›, ‹2› and ‹3›.
I will begin with the feline we have at home:

# Intro
There is an extensive description of reduplication phenomena in Lushootseed dating back to at least the 1950s (QUOTE NEEDED).
