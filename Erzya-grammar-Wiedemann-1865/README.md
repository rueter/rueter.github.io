# Erzya grammar by Wiedemann 1865
F. J. Wiedemann's grammar of Erzya is based on previous research work by Herr Conrad von Der Gabelentz (1838â€“39) and interviews with native speakers he had access to in  Reval (Tallinn). No fieldwork was conducted in the Erzya homeland.
The grammar can be viewed [here](https://rueter.github.io/Erzya-grammar-Wiedemann-1865/WiedemannFJ-Grammatik-der-ersa-mordwinischen-Sprache-1865.html).
