# Erzya grammar by Gabelentz, 1838–39
Herr Conrad von Der Gabelentz's grammar is an erudite interpretation of grammatical phenomena to be found in the first Erzya translation of the Gospel published in 1821, i.e. this is the first bit of parallel corpus work in Erzya studies.
The grammar can be viewed [here](https://rueter.github.io/emerald/historical-mordvin-grammars/docs/GabelentzHCVonDer-Versuch-einer-mordwinischen-Grammatik-1838-39.html).

# Erzya grammar by Wiedemann 1865

The Gabelentz and Wiedemann materials are being made available for development of Erzya-language documentation partially funded by the University of Helsinki by employing Janine Siewiert in 2018. Janine did the final proofreading and completed the html format as well as drafting a wordlist.

Work with Riabov dates back to 1997–2004 when Jack Rueter taught Finnish at the Mordovia State University Ogariov, in Saransk, Mordovia, Russian Federation.
