The role of the church in organizing the education of the Saami people was central for about 300 years. The teaching was connected with the missionary undertaking of the church, and the building of churches served the authorities? bid for power. The question of the language of instruction and the position of Saami languages within instruction has permeated the history of Saami education. The Saami languages only gained a more established footing in education when the Nordic countries moved over to the comprehensive school system in the 1960s and 1970s. &lt;/p>
&lt;P align="justify"> The first attempt to educate Saami boys in a Swedish school was not particularly successful. The idea was to take sixteen boys for training as priests in order that they might work as missionaries among their own people. In 1606, Daniel Hjort, an advisor of the Swedish King, forcibly took the boys and placed them in a school in Uppsala. The enterprise failed when most of the boys ran away before their schooling even started. The education of Saami boys was started in Piteå in Sweden in 1619, and the so-called {{Artikkelilinkki|0232|Skytte Lapp school}} (Skytteanska lappskola) was founded in 1632 in Lycksele. In the eighteenth century, new schools were established in conjunction with the main churches in Jokkmokk, Lycksele, Arjeplog, Jukkasjärvi, Gällivare and Utsjoki. In the mid-eighteenth century, a travelling school known as the {{Artikkelilinkki|0204|Catechetical School}} was developed to provide elementary education for the Saami, and it became the dominant educational institution for nearly 200 years. The function of the catechists was to travel from lodge to lodge, home to home and teach the children to read and write and the commandments, main prayers and articles of faith. Up to the twentieth century, some education was also given in a few so-called Lapp schools and missionary schools. The advent of the elementary school and compulsory education gradually displaced catechetical education, although the elementary schools and catechists continued working side by side for some decades.&lt;/p>
&lt;P align="justify"> In the nineteenth century in Sweden, there was a dispute about which form of school was best suited for the education of the Saami, a travelling one or a permanent one. It was claimed that permanent schools alienated the children from reindeer herding and their traditional way of life, but on the other hand the instruction provided by the catechetical schools was considered deficient. In 1913 the so-called {{Artikkelilinkki|0238|nomad school}} reform, which was also known as the 'lodge school reform', was put into effect. The main feature of the reform was the development of a special type of school for nomadic Saami children. Behind the reform there lay the philosophy of a policy of segregation "&lt;i>A Lapp shall be a Lapp&lt;/i>". The reform was opposed by the Saami, for example in a {{Artikkelilinkki|0555|Saami National Assembly}} in 1918, but in vain. Gradually, however, in the 1940s the pupils were transferred to village schools with permanent school buildings and dormitories. In the 1950s and 1960s, the nomad schools were gradually abandoned, and Saami education was integrated into the modern school system. The change-over was influenced by a report on the nomad schools, in which the Saami expert was Israel Ruong, a school inspector. This led to a committee report (SOU 1960:41) on the school attendance of Saami children which no longer regarded it as sensible educational policy to link the education of Saami children to one single occupation (reindeer husbandry). The tradition of the nomad schools was, however, continued by the Saami schools, whose purpose was to satisfy the particular occupational, cultural and linguistic needs of the Saami. A Saami folk high school (&lt;i>Samernas folkhögskola&lt;/i>) established in Sorsele in 1942 was transferred to Jokkmokk in 1945, and it became an important institution of further education for many Saamis.&lt;/P>
&lt;P align="justify"> The elementary school principle, which guaranteed the right to an education for everyone, gained ground in the nineteenth century. The first statute on elementary education in Finland was passed in 1866. The elementary schools and the education provided by the catechists operated side by side until the middle of the twentieth century. The first elementary school in the Saami area was established in Utsjoki in 1878. It was later transferred to the village of Outakoski. Outakoski Elementary School was the only school in the early twentieth century to use the Saami language in teaching. The position of the Saami language in the curriculum was non-existent through the period of the elementary schools. An attempt was made to rectify the situation in the 1920s and 1930s by the Rector of Inari, Tuomo Itkonen, who demanded that Saami children should have the right to be taught in their own tongue. In the early 1930s, he created a ABC primer of the North Saami language, which was finally published in 1935 after various vicissitudes and some strong opposition. In order to advance the publication of the primer, the {{Artikkelilinkki|0511|Society for the Promotion of Saami Culture}} was founded in 1932, and it went on to be an active organ for the advancement of Saami affairs, publishing dozens of works in Saami as well as the Saami language periodical {{Artikkelilinkki|0319|&lt;i>Sápmelaš&lt;/i>}}. The first law on compulsory education in Finland came into force in 1921, but it was not until the law of 1947 that compulsory education applied to all children, including those who lived more than five kilometres away from a school. The first regulations regarding the 'Lappish language' were inscribed in the Elementary School Act of 1957. Saami education was still dependent on enlightened teachers, and the position of the Saami language continued to be weak. In Inari the Saami Christian Folk High School (&lt;i>Sámii kristalaš nuoraiskuvla&lt;/i>) was founded in 1953, and in the following decades it became an important further educational establishment for young Saamis.&lt;/p>
&lt;P align="justify"> The education of the Saami in Norway was started by Thomas {{Artikkelilinkki|1631|von Westen}} (1682-1727), who was known as ?the Apostle of the Saami?. On his initiative, an institutuion called &lt;i>Seminarium Lapponicum&lt;/i> was founded in Trondheim in 1752 to train Saami teachers, but it was closed after his death. In 1752 a new &lt;i>Seminarium Lapponicum&lt;/i> was opened thanks to the efforts of Knud Leem, a clergyman, folklorist and linguist. Leem did pioneering work in the education of the Saami, publishing numerous religious tracts andan ABC primer for them. In the early nineteenth century, the teaching of Finnish and Saami was promoted by a clergyman called Nils Phede Stokfleth. In the 1850s, the attitude in Norway towards the Saami language became rather hostile, and this gradually turned into an official policy of ?Norwegianization?. First a local government act was passed which permitted posts in municipal organs in the coastal parishes to be filly only with Norwegian-speakers. This {{Artikkelilinkki|0537|assimilationist policy}} further intensified in the second half of the century. In 1862, a regulation was issued stipulating that the language of instruction in educational districts with Norwegian-speaking majorities must be Norwegian. In 1889, an Elementary Education Act was passedimposing Norwegian as the language of teaching in schools. In regions where more than one language was spoken, the act allowed for the use of Saami and Finnish as auxiliary languages. The primary task of the schools and dormitories was defined as Norwegianization. The policy of Norwegianization continued up to the late 1940s, when the educational system began to be reformed.&lt;/P>
&lt;P align="justify"> The 1970s have been described as the decade when the teaching of Saami and of other subjects in Saami began. Education was a central issue in the agendas of the Saami organizations. In Finland the changeover to the comprehensive school system began in Lapland at the beginning of the 1970s. An expert committee was set up to deal with the numerous problems involved in the teaching of Saami. The exhaustive reports and proposals of the Saami Language Curriculum Planning Committee regarding the improvement of the position of the Saami language in schools did not produce immediate results, but they provided guidelines for developments over the following decades. The teaching of Saami began in the early 1970s, and the teaching of other subjects at elementary level in Saami in 1975. This was based on a provision of the Comprehensive Schools Act endorsing the right of Lappish-speaking pupils to receive instruction in their own mother tongue as well as far as circumstanced permitted. In Norway, the teaching of Saami began in 1967. The 1975 Comprehensive School act provided for the teaching of Saami both as a mother tongue and as a second language in the Saami areas. The Norwegian Ministry of education set up a special advisory educational council ({{Artikkelilinkki|0236|&lt;i>Samisk utdanningsråd&lt;/i>}}). In Sweden, the name of the nomad schools was changed to Saami school? (sameskola) in 1977, and a separate administration (Sameskolstyrelsen/Sámiskulastivra) was set up for them. In Gällivare there was a special Saami upper comprehensive school from 1964 to 1984, which was to provide a joint middle school for all the nomad schools. When the middle school and some Saami schools were closed, Saami culture began to be integrated into the curriculum of the public schools in the early 1980s (Integrated Saami education). Instruction in the Saami language began in public schools in 1976 as a result of an educational reform in Sweden concerning the home languages of the children of immigrants and members of linguistic minorities. &lt;/P>
&lt;P align="justify">The teaching of the Saami language and other subjects in Saami developed in numerous ways in the Nordic countries in the 1980s. In Finland it became possible to take Saami as a second language in the Matriculation Examination (taken at the end of senior secondary school) in 1980. The first legislative reform concerning the comprehensive school in 1983 replaced the term Lappish language with Saami language?. According to the new regulations, the Saami language could be used as the language of instruction in the Saami area, and it could be taught both as part of the subject of mother tongue and as a second language. By the end of the decade, instruction in the Saami language was being given in all the schools in the Saami area. The Ministry of Education established an advisory body called the Saami Council for Educational Affairs (&lt;i>Saamelaisten koulutusasiainneuvosto&lt;/i>) in 1986 to promote the development of the Saamis' education. In Sweden, the Saami Schools Board strove to strengthen the position of the Saami languages in the Saami schools by drawing up different Saami language syllabi to suit the varying skills of the pupils. A new Saami school began to operate in Kiruna in 1896, and integrated Saami education became established in 1987. In Norway, the Comprehensive School Act of 1985 enabled instruction to be given in Saami at the lower comprehensive level for the first time. Saami syllabi for eight subjects were approved as part of the comprehensive school curriculum in 1989. A Saami University College (&lt;i>Sámi allaskuvla&lt;/i>) was established in Kautokeino in 1989, marking the beginning of higher education in Saami.&lt;/P>
&lt;P align="justify">The legislation on education in the Nordic countries (Educational legislation) was changed on several occasions during the 1990s. In Finland, the Saami language is today taught in all schools in the Saami Homeland, and pupils are taught in Saami in Utsjoki, Enontekiö and Inari. In Inari, all three of the Saami languages spoken in Finland (North, Inari and Skolt Saami) are used as languages of instruction. Saami-language instruction is put into effect most extensively in the first six years of basic education. In later classes, there is little teaching in Saami, and in the senior secondary school none at all. In the national Matriculation Examination, it is possible to take Finnish both as a mother tongue and as a second language. The number of pupils being taught in Saami is increasing, amounting at present to about 150 a year. Outside the Saami Homeland, Saami-language instruction is given to small groups in Oulu, Rovaniemi and Sodankylä.&lt;/P>
&lt;P align="justify">In Norway, about 3000 pupils in the comprehensive and senior secondary schools are taught the Saami language and given instruction in other subjects in it. Instruction in Saami is most extensive in areas where North Saami is widely spoken, i.e. the municipalities of the Saami Administrative Area. The language itself is taught all over the country. In Oslo children can learn Saami from playschool to senior secondary school. The areas where South Saami is spoken are located in four different provinces: Nordland, North Tröndelag, South Tröndelag and Hedmark, and South Saami-speakers do not constitute a majority of the population of any single municipality. South Saami is mainly taught as a second language to about sixty pupils. The main Lule Saami area is located in the municipality of Tysfjord, and at present about forty pupils are taught Lule Saami. In Norway cultural centres have been established to preserve the Saami language and culture; for example, Lule Saami- speakers have their own cultural centre called Árran. In addition to the municipal schools, there are three special Saami schools in Norway: Hattfjeld South Saami School (established in 1951), Snåsa Saami School and Målselv Saami School (1983) in Tromsrø.&lt;/P>
&lt;P align="justify"> In Sweden, there are today six Saami schools (in Karesuando, Lannavaara, Kiruna, Gällivare, Jokkmokk and Tärnaby). The proportion of instruction in Saami in them has been increased from the 1990s on. According to the existing regulations, the schools are responsible for ensuring that every pupil who has attended a Saami school is acquainted with the Saami cultural heritage and can speak, read and write a Saami language (North, Lule or South Saami). Today there are also Saami day-care centres and kindergartens operating in conjunction with the schools. The administration of the Saami schools is also responsible for seeing to it that integrated Saami education is implemented in public schools. The position of integrated Saami education in these schools is not very strong: about 300-400 pupils per year receive various alternative courses for Saamis.&lt;/p>
&lt;P align="justify"> Education in {{Artikkelilinkki|0109|Kildinsaami}} is given 9 hours a week in 1-4 grades in Lovozero in the Kola Peninsula. Teaching materials have been written in the writing system developed by a group Rimma Kuruch-Nina Afanassieva-Iraida Vinogradova.&lt;BR>&lt;BR>&lt;/p>

The advent of the elementary school and compulsory education gradually displaced catechetical education, although the elementary schools and catechists continued working side by side for some decades.&lt;/p>&#10;&lt;P align=&quot;justify&quot;> In the nineteenth century in Sweden, there was a dispute about which form of school was best suited for the education of the Saami, a travelling one or a permanent one. It was claimed that permanent schools alienated the children from reindeer herding and their traditional way of life, but on the other hand the instruction provided by the catechetical schools was considered deficient. In 1913 the so-called {{Artikkelilinkki|0238|nomad school}} reform, which was also known as the 'lodge school reform', was put into effect. The main feature of the reform was the development of a special type of school for nomadic Saami children. Behind the reform there lay the philosophy of a policy of segregation &quot;&lt;i>A Lapp shall be a Lapp&lt;/i>&quot;. The reform was opposed by the Saami, for example in a {{Artikkelilinkki|0555|Saami National Assembly}} in 1918, but in vain. Gradually, however, in the 1940s the pupils were transferred to village schools with permanent school buildings and dormitories. In the 1950s and 1960s, the nomad schools were gradually abandoned, and Saami education was integrated into the modern school system. The change-over was influenced by a report on the nomad schools, in which the Saami expert was Israel Ruong, a school inspector. This led to a committee report (SOU 1960:41) on the school attendance of Saami children which no longer regarded it as sensible educational policy to link the education of Saami children to one single occupation (reindeer husbandry). The tradition of the nomad schools was, however, continued by the Saami schools, whose purpose was to satisfy the particular occupational, cultural and linguistic needs of the Saami. A Saami folk high school (&lt;i>Samernas folkhögskola&lt;/i>) established in Sorsele in 1942 was transferred to Jokkmokk in 1945, and it became an important institution of further education for many Saamis.&lt;/P>&#10;&lt;P align=&quot;justify&quot;> The elementary school principle, which guaranteed the right to an education for everyone, gained ground in the nineteenth century. The first statute on elementary education in Finland was passed in 1866. The elementary schools and the education provided by the catechists operated side by side until the middle of the twentieth century. The first elementary school in the Saami area was established in Utsjoki in 1878. It was later transferred to the village of Outakoski. Outakoski Elementary School was the only school in the early twentieth century to use the Saami language in teaching. The position of the Saami language in the curriculum was non-existent through the period of the elementary schools. An attempt was made to rectify the situation in the 1920s and 1930s by the Rector of Inari, Tuomo Itkonen, who demanded that Saami children should have the right to be taught in their own tongue. In the early 1930s, he created a ABC primer of the North Saami language, which was finally published in 1935 after various vicissitudes and some strong opposition. In order to advance the publication of the primer, the {{Artikkelilinkki|0511|Society for the Promotion of Saami Culture}} was founded in 1932, and it went on to be an active organ for the advancement of Saami affairs, publishing dozens of works in Saami as well as the Saami language periodical {{Artikkelilinkki|0319|&lt;i>Sápmelaš&lt;/i>}}. The first law on compulsory education in Finland came into force in 1921, but it was not until the law of 1947 that compulsory education applied to all children, including those who lived more than five kilometres away from a school. The first regulations regarding the 'Lappish language' were inscribed in the Elementary School Act of 1957. Saami education was still dependent on enlightened teachers, and the position of the Saami language continued to be weak. In Inari the Saami Christian Folk High School (&lt;i>Sámii kristalaš nuoraiskuvla&lt;/i>) was founded in 1953, and in the following decades it became an important further educational establishment for young Saamis.&lt;/p>&#10;&lt;P align=&quot;justify&quot;> The education of the Saami in Norway was started by Thomas {{Artikkelilinkki|1631|von Westen}} (1682-1727), who was known as ?the Apostle of the Saami?. On his initiative, an institutuion called &lt;i>Seminarium Lapponicum&lt;/i> was founded in Trondheim in 1752 to train Saami teachers, but it was closed after his death. In 1752 a new &lt;i>Seminarium Lapponicum&lt;/i> was opened thanks to the efforts of Knud Leem, a clergyman, folklorist and linguist. Leem did pioneering work in the education of the Saami, publishing numerous religious tracts andan ABC primer for them. In the early nineteenth century, the teaching of Finnish and Saami was promoted by a clergyman called Nils Phede Stokfleth. In the 1850s, the attitude in Norway towards the Saami language became rather hostile, and this gradually turned into an official policy of ?Norwegianization?. First a local government act was passed which permitted posts in municipal organs in the coastal parishes to be filly only with Norwegian-speakers. This {{Artikkelilinkki|0537|assimilationist policy}} further intensified in the second half of the century. In 1862, a regulation was issued stipulating that the language of instruction in educational districts with Norwegian-speaking majorities must be Norwegian. In 1889, an Elementary Education Act was passedimposing Norwegian as the language of teaching in schools. In regions where more than one language was spoken, the act allowed for the use of Saami and Finnish as auxiliary languages. The primary task of the schools and dormitories was defined as Norwegianization. The policy of Norwegianization continued up to the late 1940s, when the educational system began to be reformed.&lt;/P>&#10;&lt;P align=&quot;justify&quot;> The 1970s have been described as the decade when the teaching of Saami and of other subjects in Saami began. Education was a central issue in the agendas of the Saami organizations. In Finland the changeover to the comprehensive school system began in Lapland at the beginning of the 1970s. An expert committee was set up to deal with the numerous problems involved in the teaching of Saami. The exhaustive reports and proposals of the Saami Language Curriculum Planning Committee regarding the improvement of the position of the Saami language in schools did not produce immediate results, but they provided guidelines for developments over the following decades. The teaching of Saami began in the early 1970s, and the teaching of other subjects at elementary level in Saami in 1975. This was based on a provision of the Comprehensive Schools Act endorsing the right of Lappish-speaking pupils to receive instruction in their own mother tongue as well as far as circumstanced permitted. In Norway, the teaching of Saami began in 1967. The 1975 Comprehensive School act provided for the teaching of Saami both as a mother tongue and as a second language in the Saami areas. The Norwegian Ministry of education set up a special advisory educational council ({{Artikkelilinkki|0236|&lt;i>Samisk utdanningsråd&lt;/i>}}). In Sweden, the name of the nomad schools was changed to Saami school? (sameskola) in 1977, and a separate administration (Sameskolstyrelsen/Sámiskulastivra) was set up for them. In Gällivare there was a special Saami upper comprehensive school from 1964 to 1984, which was to provide a joint middle school for all the nomad schools. When the middle school and some Saami schools were closed, Saami culture began to be integrated into the curriculum of the public schools in the early 1980s (Integrated Saami education). Instruction in the Saami language began in public schools in 1976 as a result of an educational reform in Sweden concerning the home languages of the children of immigrants and members of linguistic minorities. &lt;/P>&#10;&lt;P align=&quot;justify&quot;>The teaching of the Saami language and other subjects in Saami developed in numerous ways in the Nordic countries in the 1980s. In Finland it became possible to take Saami as a second language in the Matriculation Examination (taken at the end of senior secondary school) in 1980. The first legislative reform concerning the comprehensive school in 1983 replaced the term Lappish language with Saami language?. According to the new regulations, the Saami language could be used as the language of instruction in the Saami area, and it could be taught both as part of the subject of mother tongue and as a second language. By the end of the decade, instruction in the Saami language was being given in all the schools in the Saami area. The Ministry of Education established an advisory body called the Saami Council for Educational Affairs (&lt;i>Saamelaisten koulutusasiainneuvosto&lt;/i>) in 1986 to promote the development of the Saamis' education. In Sweden, the Saami Schools Board strove to strengthen the position of the Saami languages in the Saami schools by drawing up different Saami language syllabi to suit the varying skills of the pupils. A new Saami school began to operate in Kiruna in 1896, and integrated Saami education became established in 1987. In Norway, the Comprehensive School Act of 1985 enabled instruction to be given in Saami at the lower comprehensive level for the first time. Saami syllabi for eight subjects were approved as part of the comprehensive school curriculum in 1989. A Saami University College (&lt;i>Sámi allaskuvla&lt;/i>) was established in Kautokeino in 1989, marking the beginning of higher education in Saami.&lt;/P>&#10;&lt;P align=&quot;justify&quot;>The legislation on education in the Nordic countries (Educational legislation) was changed on several occasions during the 1990s. In Finland, the Saami language is today taught in all schools in the Saami Homeland, and pupils are taught in Saami in Utsjoki, Enontekiö and Inari. In Inari, all three of the Saami languages spoken in Finland (North, Inari and Skolt Saami) are used as languages of instruction. Saami-language instruction is put into effect most extensively in the first six years of basic education. In later classes, there is little teaching in Saami, and in the senior secondary school none at all. In the national Matriculation Examination, it is possible to take Finnish both as a mother tongue and as a second language. The number of pupils being taught in Saami is increasing, amounting at present to about 150 a year. Outside the Saami Homeland, Saami-language instruction is given to small groups in Oulu, Rovaniemi and Sodankylä.&lt;/P>&#10;&lt;P align=&quot;justify&quot;>In Norway, about 3000 pupils in the comprehensive and senior secondary schools are taught the Saami language and given instruction in other subjects in it. Instruction in Saami is most extensive in areas where North Saami is widely spoken, i.e. the municipalities of the Saami Administrative Area. The language itself is taught all over the country. In Oslo children can learn Saami from playschool to senior secondary school. The areas where South Saami is spoken are located in four different provinces: Nordland, North Tröndelag, South Tröndelag and Hedmark, and South Saami-speakers do not constitute a majority of the population of any single municipality. South Saami is mainly taught as a second language to about sixty pupils. The main Lule Saami area is located in the municipality of Tysfjord, and at present about forty pupils are taught Lule Saami. In Norway cultural centres have been established to preserve the Saami language and culture; for example, Lule Saami- speakers have their own cultural centre called Árran. In addition to the municipal schools, there are three special Saami schools in Norway: Hattfjeld South Saami School (established in 1951), Snåsa Saami School and Målselv Saami School (1983) in Tromsrø.&lt;/P>&#10;&lt;P align=&quot;justify&quot;> In Sweden, there are today six Saami schools (in Karesuando, Lannavaara, Kiruna, Gällivare, Jokkmokk and Tärnaby). The proportion of instruction in Saami in them has been increased from the 1990s on. According to the existing regulations, the schools are responsible for ensuring that every pupil who has attended a Saami school is acquainted with the Saami cultural heritage and can speak, read and write a Saami language (North, Lule or South Saami). Today there are also Saami day-care centres and kindergartens operating in conjunction with the schools. The administration of the Saami schools is also responsible for seeing to it that integrated Saami education is implemented in public schools. The position of integrated Saami education in these schools is not very strong: about 300-400 pupils per year receive various alternative courses for Saamis.&lt;/p>&#10;&lt;P align=&quot;justify&quot;> Education in {{Artikkelilinkki|0109|Kildinsaami}} is given 9 hours a week in 1-4 grades in Lovozero in the Kola Peninsula. Teaching materials have been written in the writing system developed by a group Rimma Kuruch-Nina Afanassieva-Iraida Vinogradova.&lt;BR>&lt;BR>&lt;/p>&#10;{{Artikkelilinkki|0215|Higher education}}&lt;BR>&#10;{{Artikkelilinkki|0220|Educational materials}}&lt;BR>&#10;Educational legislation&lt;BR>&lt;BR>" name="Artikkeli[artikkeliteksti]" />
