## Erzya grammar by Gabelentz, 1838–39

## Grammar of Erzya by Evsevʹev 1928–29
Makar Evsevʹevič Evsevʹev published a most extensive grammar of the Erzya language in the end of the 1920s.
The paragraphs of the grammar have id attributes at the beginning of each paragraph for encouraging linking, i.e., when the text shows «§ 1.», the id attribute is (id="§1.").

## Thanks

The Gabelentz and Wiedemann materials are being made available for development of Erzya-language documentation partially funded by the University of Helsinki by employing Janine Siewiert in 2018. Janine did the final proofreading and completed the html format as well as drafting a wordlist.

Work with Riabov dates back to 1997–2004 when Jack Rueter taught Finnish at the Mordovia State University Ogariov, in Saransk, Mordovia, Russian Federation.
