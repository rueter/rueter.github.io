# Introduction


# Heikki Paasonen's Mordwinisches Wörterbuch
Approximately on century after the commence of Heikki Paasonen's first fieldwork among the Mordvin, the [Finno-Ugrian Society](https://www.sgr.fi/) published four volumes of his dialect dictionary of the Mordvin languages, 1990, 1992, 1994 and 1996: [Heikki Paasonen's Mordwinisches Wörterbuch](https://www.sgr.fi/fi/items/show/413).

The materials of these four volumes contain over 2700 pages dedicated to fieldwork collections featuring approximately 220 locales.

The dictionary itself is found in the XML file ```mordwinisches_woerterbuch_all.xml```.

At present, the XML file is under development for use as a SQL database. It contains all of the nearly 7,000 macro articles of the dialect dictionary of the Mordvin languages, Erzya and Moksha.

Development includes:
* alignment of all phonetic variants with their geo_locale.
* introduction of links to the modern Erzya and Moksha language dictionaries.
* alignment of definitions with the geo_locales where these meanings are pertinent.
* alignment of all example sentences with their geo_locale and literary sources.
