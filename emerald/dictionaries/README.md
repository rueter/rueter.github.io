# Introduction


# Heikki Paasonen's Mordwinisches Wörterbuch
Approximately on century after the commence of Heikki Paasonen's first fieldwork among the Mordvin, the [Finno-Ugrian Society](https://www.sgr.fi/) published four volumes of his dialect dictionary of the Mordvin languages, 1990, 1992, 1994 and 1996: [Heikki Paasonen's Mordwinisches Wörterbuch](https://www.sgr.fi/fi/items/show/413).
* XXIII:1. 1990. CVI + 557 p. Band I (A–J).
* XXIII:2. 1992. P. 558-1305. Band II (K–M).
* XXIII:3. 1994. P. 1306-1927. Band III (N–Ŕ).
* XXIII:4. 1996. P. 1928-2703. Band IV (S–Ž).

The materials of these four volumes contain over 2700 pages dedicated to fieldwork collections featuring approximately 220 locales, which have been expanded upon for more extensive documentation of the Mordvin langauges in space and time [here](erme_geo.csv). 

The dictionary itself is found in the XML file ```mordwinisches_woerterbuch_all.xml```.

You can search the four volumes of the dictionary as an html file [here](docs/mw_paasonen_original_ib.html), where you can read it in you browser and make simple searches -- nowadays, searches don't require «funny letters».

At present, the XML file is under development for use as a SQL database. It contains all of the nearly 7,000 macro articles of the dialect dictionary of the Mordvin languages, Erzya and Moksha.

Development includes:
* alignment of all phonetic variants with their geo_locale.
* introduction of links to the modern Erzya and Moksha language dictionaries.
* alignment of definitions with the geo_locales where these meanings are pertinent.
* alignment of all example sentences with their geo_locale and literary sources.
