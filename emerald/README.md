# Introduction
The repository is a collection of open-source materials, dictionaries and other related items for work with
the description of Erzya, Moksha and other closely related Mordvin language forms. The subdirectories have relatively descriptive names and each one comes with a README.md of its own:
* [dictionaries](dictionaries/README.md) (development of Paasonen Dialect Dictionary of the Mordvin Languages)
* [erme](erme/README.md) (Electronic Resourses for Moksha and Erzya)
* [fieldwork-and-early-literary-texts](fieldwork-and-early-literary-texts/README.md)
* [historical-mordvin-grammars](historical-mordvin-grammars/README.md) (beginning with Gabelentz, Wiedemann, Evesevʹev, Râbov)
* [myv_new-testament_1821-1827](myv_new-testament_1821-1827/README.md) (this directory has been separated from the other early literature)
* [shoks_kolkhoznikinj-valjgij-1932-33](shoks_kolkhoznikinj-valjgij-1932-33/README.md) (a collection of newspaper articles written in the language form Shoksha)
